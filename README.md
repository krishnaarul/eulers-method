# eulers-method
Python (and eventually Java and more) implementations of Leonhard Euler's method for approximating values on functions defined by non-seperable differential equations.

I am going to add more implementations in different languages, I am starting with Python because it can be imported into graphing calculators like Ti-84 and Numworks.
